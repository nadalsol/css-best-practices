## 1. What is ITCSS?

<img src="./img/itcss-cover.png" alt="ITCSS" />

**ITCSS** is a simple effective **methodology** to help **manage, maintain, and scale CSS projects** of all sizes. ITCSS stands for **Inverted Triangle** architecture for **CSS**.

## 2. The CSS problem

> It doesn't matter how well-considered your **source order** is; how well you're **utilising the cascade**; what **naming conventions** you use; **specificity can undo everything**.

## 3. Managing CSS projects with ITCSS

<img src="./img/itcss-01.png" alt="Specificity order" />

In short: **write CSS in specificity order**.

### Default layers

1. **Settings:** Global variables, config switches.
2. **Tools:** Default mixins and functions.
3. **Generic:** Ground-zero styles (Normalize.css, resets, box-sizing).
4. **Base:** Unclassed HTML elements (type selectors).
5. **Objects:** Cosmetic-free design patterns.
6. **Components:** Designed components, chunks of UI.
7. **Trumps:** Helpers and overrides.
