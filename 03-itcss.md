## 1. What is ITCSS?

ITCSS is a simple effective methodology to help manage, maintain, and scale CSS projects of all sizes. ITCSS stands for _Inverted Triangle_ architecture for _CSS_.

## 2. The CSS Problem

> It doesn't matter how well-considered your **source order** is; how well you're **utilising the cascade**; what **naming conventions** you use; **specificity can undo everything**.
> ‚Äì Harry Roberts

## 3. Managing CSS Projects with ITCSS

In short: **Write CSS in Specificity Order**.

### Default layers

1. **Settings:** Global variables, config switches.
2. **Tools:** Default mixins and functions.
3. **Generic:** Ground-zero styles (Normalize.css, resets, box-sizing).
4. **Base:** Unclassed HTML elements (type selectors).
5. **Objects:** Cosmetic-free design patterns.
6. **Components:** Designed components, chunks of UI.
7. **Trumps:** Helpers and overrides.

- The **Specificity Wars are over**!

## 4. Recap

- Write CSS in **specificity order**.
- Maintain the **Specificity Graph**.
- All rulesets should only ever **add to and inherit from previous ones**.
- Order stylesheets from **far-reaching to very localised**.
- Add layers as needed, but only **in the right place**.
