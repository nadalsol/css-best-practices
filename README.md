# CSS best practices at Hack&Craft

## Why this talk?

Writing good, scalable and easy to maintain HTML and CSS is key for any front-end project.

There are multiple reasons for that: **reusability**, **performance**, **accessibility**, **maintainability**, **semantics**, **consistency**, **developer experience**â€¦ just to mention some of them.

Besides, I noticed some interest from other developers, as they eventually had some frictions when touching [front of the front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/) code in our projects. They usually want to know:

- Why this or that has been done on a certain way?
- What good practices and methodologies should they follow?

## Summary

I'll talk about why I'm coding CSS (and some HTML) on a certain way, based on **good practices I learned during years**. I'll cover topics like:

1. [CSS specificity](https://github.com/nadalsol/css-best-practices-at-hnc/blob/main/01-css-specificity.md)
2. [BEM methodology](https://github.com/nadalsol/css-best-practices-at-hnc/blob/main/02-bem-methodology.md)
3. [ITCSS](https://github.com/nadalsol/css-best-practices-at-hnc/blob/main/03-itcss.md)
4. [Reusable HTML patterns](https://github.com/nadalsol/css-best-practices-at-hnc/blob/main/04-reusable-html-patterns.md)
5. [Common bad practices (and how to address them)](https://github.com/nadalsol/css-best-practices-at-hnc/blob/main/05-common-bad-practices.md)
6. [Final thoughts](https://github.com/nadalsol/css-best-practices-at-hnc/blob/main/06-final-thoughts.md)
7. Q&A

_Notice: Some of these are broad topics to cover, thus I'll try to teach you the essentials while illustrating them with real code examples._

## Considerations

- Most examples written in Sass (`*.scss` syntax).
- Feel free to experiment with code during this talk.
- Tools like [SassMeister](https://www.sassmeister.com/) or [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) may be helpful.
