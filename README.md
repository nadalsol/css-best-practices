# CSS Best Practices

Writing good [front of the front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/) code is key for any front-end project ✨ 🎨 📐

There are multiple reasons for that: _reusability, performance, accessibility, maintainability, semantics, consistency, better developer experience…_

## 5 basic principles

Based on **good practices I learned** during some years:

1. [CSS specificity](https://github.com/nadalsol/css-best-practices-at-hnc/blob/main/01-css-specificity.md)
2. [BEM methodology](https://github.com/nadalsol/css-best-practices-at-hnc/blob/main/02-bem-methodology.md)
3. [ITCSS](https://github.com/nadalsol/css-best-practices-at-hnc/blob/main/03-itcss.md)
4. [Reusable HTML patterns](https://github.com/nadalsol/css-best-practices-at-hnc/blob/main/04-reusable-html-patterns.md)
5. [Common bad practices (and how to address them)](https://github.com/nadalsol/css-best-practices-at-hnc/blob/main/05-common-bad-practices.md)
