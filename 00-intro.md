# "Front of the front-end" best practices

## Why this talk?

Writing good, scalable and easy to maintain HTML and CSS is key for any front-end project.

There are multiple reasons for that: reusability, performance, accessibility, maintainability, semantics, consistency, developer experienceâ€¦ just to mention some of them.

Besides, I noticed some interest from other developers, as they eventually had some frictions when touching "front of the front-end" code in our projects. They usually want to know:

- Why this or that has been done on a certain way?
- What good practices and methodologies should they follow?

## Summary

I'll talk about why I'm coding HTML and CSS on a certain way (based on good practices I learned during some years). I'll cover topics like:

1. [CSS Specificity](http://www.standardista.com/css3/css-specificity/)
2. [BEM methodology](https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/)
3. [ITCSS](https://speakerdeck.com/dafed/managing-css-projects-with-itcss)
4. Reusable HTML patterns
5. Common Bad Practices (and how to address them)
6. Final Thoughts
7. Q&A

Some of these are broad topics to cover, thus I'll try to teach you the essentials while illustrating them with real code examples.

## Considerations

- Most examples written in Sass (`*.scss` syntax).
- Feel free to experiment with code during this talk.
- Tools like [SassMeister](https://www.sassmeister.com/) or [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) will be helpful.
